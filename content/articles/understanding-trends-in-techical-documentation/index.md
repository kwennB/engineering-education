### INTRODUCTION
Technical writing needs many skills, awareness of technology, writing ability, and soft skills. Technical Documentation is the process used to deliver knowledge on how to use a product. It is a detailed guide for users, developers, new hires, and management. Every product and service needs to provide a medium to teach users how it works. This happens through proper documentation. 
Documentation improves quality, reduces cost for support. It results in ease of use for the software. Poor documentation makes projects suffer from scalability, accessibility, and user approval. There are many resources on general documentation; how to integrate APIs, ways to format technical documentation, there are not many about the backend work that goes on within writers, developers, and engineers alike. The aim of the article is for its content to be easily comprehended by new technical writers and non-tech writers exploring the field, seasoned writers, and anyone working on documentation. Documentation does not have to be a tedious job, some of the things that kill the success of the job are lack of experience, little or no writing efficiency, and using tools not optimized for ease of use. You don’t have to be a senior engineer to document API.

### HOW WRITERS INTERACT WITH DEVELOPERS

It is important to understand how you write and how others write in your field. This knowledge gives room to create more tailored documentation for the target audiences. There is the perception that technical writers don’t need to know languages to do the job. I am not writing to agree or disagree with the perception but I will state what works better. It helps to know programming languages as a Technical Writer, but it’s the exception, rather than the rule. It’s not required to get the job but, most organizations use these metrics to hire technical writers. On professional grounds, writers with programming knowledge stand a better advantage. For some documentation, the writer gets to write the code annotations for users. Interact with API, suggest code flow for the documentation. It is easier to communicate and get the job done when you are
adept with the languages and technologies. 

**General (How to) Process to Interact with Developers** 

*	Attend Scrum standups 
*	Take part in the developer’s code review.
*	If you write codes yourself, review them; Using a code review tool or in-person review. 
*	Publish codes for contributions from developers. Using GitHub or a similar hosting service. 
*	Follow style guides 
*	Publish your document

### FORMAT FOR OUTPUT AND RESPONSES 

There are various source formats, the most used are plain text, HTML & XML. 

FORMAT OUTPUT

**Docs (Documents):** One of the oldest forms of output, started as a format to only write plain texts. Upgraded to include images and graphics. It doesn’t support GIFs or videos. You'd include the link to the video resource and open it with third-party applications. 

**Portable Document Format (PDF):** Released by Adobe in June 1993. Used to output text, images, graphs, annotations, videos, layers, form fields, 3D objects. Also, file attachments, digital signatures, metadata. Works with all operating systems. PDF allows various forms of content and they are convenient for technical documentation. 

**Compiled HTML (CHM):** Created by Microsoft. Used for software documentation in various languages not limited to only HTML. It’s used to output business standards documentation, manuals, programming language tutorials. 

**Online Documentation:** Documentation viewed with internet connection and web browser. Ranging from; tutorials, technical articles, documents in software websites, etc. 

Video Tutorial: This is the most interactive documentation format. Tutorials, user guides, etc.

### WORKFLOW AND BEST PRACTICES 

**Workflow** 

Workflows give your documentation the free flow, it structures creativity. To write better documentation, it is best practice to use workflows. There are various kinds of workflows and software tools that help design workflows. Tools like; JIRA, Asana etc. 
Seasoned writers work with workflows depending on the kind of documentation. It could get tedious trying to organize every detail in your head. Some end up working on a workflow after starting the drafts. Although, it’s best to do this before documenting. 

For those new to the practice, here’s a general guide to building a workflow;

*	Goal 
*	 Content /Subject area 
*	 Scope 
*	 Document type 
*	 Audience 
*	 Modes of publication (Output) 

Understand the current workflow used in your team/business. How does communication work, who vets the workflow? (peer reviewer, editor, what tools, outputs, etc).

Identify deliverables: What are you trying to deliver with your workflow? List out the intended result.

List the process steps and tasks: The (how to) process for the result of your workflow 

Identify roles: List the specific tasks of everyone assigned to the process workflow. Interview members of the team involved in the process. 

Create the workflow diagram 

Test the workflow 

Review the workflow with your team 

Publish the workflow so everyone included in the process can have access. 

#### **WORKFLOW BASED ON THE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTATION** 


**Process Documentation**

*	Define the scope and process (Research) 
*	Organize the steps (Workflow) 
*	Audience analysis: Research, Users personas, Audience interviews, user experience. (Depends on the kind of documentation). 
*	Structure and Markup: This varies for the kinds of documentation. Title/Headers, Abstract, Table of content, Chapters, Sections, References/Contributors 
*	Review and test the process 
*	Publish 

> Best practice in process documentation requires you to include set up, prerequisite, functionality. Also, screen reference diagrams and images. 

**Business Documentation**

*	Define the process 
*	Document the step by step process 
*	Confirm the outputs (varies for the kind of documentation) (add a footnote) 
*	Review the workflow process and share with the development team (if it applies) 
*	Start your drafts 

**Product Documentation**

*	Research Audience Analysis 
*	Structure Information 
*	Outline documentation process (Create a plan) 
*	Organize accessibility (Navigation, images, key points, highlights) 

**WHY IS DOCUMENT WORKFLOW IMPORTANT?**

1. Lower Costs 
2.  Increase Productivity by Accelerating Processes 
3. Document Workflow Improves Collaboration 
4. Increase Transparency and Compliance 
5. Automates repetitive processes 
6. Alerts users about uncompleted tasks 
7. Provides a document workflow picture, with performance metrics 

**BEST PRACTICES** 

1. Establish a working infrastructure between the development team and the technical writing team. 
2. Fix content specifications early on and distribute them to the team. Content specs include; deliverables, document milestones, resource planning, dependencies, assumptions, and constraints. This is easy with Scrum. 
3. Use style guides: 
•	Microsoft style-guide 
•	Google style-guide 
•	 Red Hat’s style guide 
4. Write in the correct style; 
•	 Use concise and accurate words 
•	 Avoid jargon: To appeal to experts or not consider non-technical readers. Define unfamiliar technical terms, write out the complete meanings of abbreviations. 
•	 Check for spelling errors and correct them. 
•	 Add visual formats: Images pass many messages 
5. Summaries: It is best to include a descriptive summary of a section/chapter. 
6. Accessibility (Make it easy for users to access sections and pages. Number pages, use descriptive headings. 
7. Produce output – wiki-based, different operating systems (Linux, Windows Mac OS) 
8. Update documentation to avoid stacking up legacy contents.

### INTRODUCTION TO SCRUM 

**Agile Method** - This is a process that supports continuous replication of development phases. Whilst testing through the product life cycle. Agile software development cycle takes Individual and team communication over tools and procedures, it pressures products to scale over thorough documentation, discards an outlined plan over issuing changes. 
They are three kinds of Agile methods; 
Scrum 
Extreme Programming 
Kanban 

I’d only introduce SCRUM. 

[**SCRUM**](https://www.scrum.org/): is a substructure used to facilitate teamwork and innovation. It helps in developing and organizing products in a complex setting. It concentrates on the management of tasks specific to the team development environment. So far it is the most practiced method in the modern workspace. Scrum helps teams stay organized and up to date with tasks and processes. It helps to determine when companies should scale and when not to. 

**Roles and people involved**

**Scrum Master** - The project manager. He organizes meetings, simplifies processes, and helps the team understand the processes. Organizes practical studies, writes & attests specifications, fosters a collaborative environment in the team Scrum masters should have the skill of setting meetings that do not affect the regular work of the team. 

**Product Owner** - They are the product principal and the major bridge between the product and the market. The product owners work closely with the Market Requirement Document. They handle the product backlog. They oversee the development stage and deliver performance ratios at stand-ups. The Product owner is to define the goals of the product and business, manage backlog and sprints. He is the liaison between customers and internal stakeholders. 

**Scrum team** - The compilation of everyone. Product Owner, one Scrum Master, Technical Writers, and Developers involved in the life cycle. The team manages their work, organizes their work. Also, show up for scrum meetings and collaborate to complete the cycle. 

**Stakeholders** - This is an informational role only. They should be up-to-date on the product and goals, review, approve and provide feedback. 

**Processes involved in the scrum**
*	 Project planning
*	Product roadmap creation 
*	 Release planning 
*	 Sprint planning 
*	 Daily stand-ups 
*	 Sprint reviews 

**Product Backlog** - This is a repository requirement to track details on tasks due before each release. Product Owner maintains, prioritizes, and distributes to the scrum team. The team can also request for the addition or modification of a new task or deletion.

### HOW WRITERS HANDLE OPEN API SPEC

The Open API specification is the standardized way to interact with RESTful API. You can interact with Open API [here.](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
The standards of Open API were for low code and easy usability. Open API spec doesn’t need you to rewrite RESTful APIs before use. To understand more about Open API, Bill wrote a concise introduction to Open API [here.](https://nordicapis.com/how-to-write-your-first-openapi-specification/)

**You can interact with open API in two ways;** 
1.	Creating the manual specifications with tools like Swagger.   
•	 Swagger: Made to support Open API. Swagger Code gen produces SDKs in over 40 languages, 
•	Swagger’s server tool supports both OAS 2.0 and 3.0 APIs (Charboneau, 2020). 


2.	Auto-generate your specification based on your code. Then feed the result to Swagger UI. 

Auto generating creates the Open API annotations for your code. The Code gen libraries generate the model and the valid spec that conforms to the Open API markup. 
Technical Writers rarely generate the Open API spec. the developers generate them. (To read more, check out the analysis from Johnson’s [survey.](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_trends.html)
In some cases, developers and companies don’t use Open API but use its schema to build and document their API. With knowledge of the Open API spec, tech writers can influence the names of the endpoints. The consistency and patterns, simplicity, and other factors into the design of an API (Johnson, 2020). 
Tech writers can play a key role in collaborating with the API team in producing the spec.

To take the step further and be a contributor (a patcher). Check out standardization bodies [here.](https://nordicapis.com/7-api-standards-bodies-to-get-involved-with/)

### TERMINOLOGIES

DITA: XML-based tool that lets you reuse texts across publications. It is designed to ease text authoring, translation, and reuse. It is often used to create documentation, user guides. Also, curriculum and other related materials. To get started with understanding DITA check this resource.

Document as a service(DaaS): Also known as Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). It turns unstructured contents into actionable details and is then processed for use. 

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. Transmits data in a web application, based on JavaScript. 

XML: Extensible Markup Language. Describes texts in a digital document. 

YAML: Yet Another Markup Language: For writing readable data configuration files. A subset of JSON. 

RAML: RESTful API Modeling Language: Describes REST API. It makes it readable to computers and humans. 6HyperMedia: The collection of digital information like text, videos, audio, graphics, recordings. These hyperlinks are then accessed on display in the same document. In API, it helps build services that'd work independently from the server and client.



### CONCLUSION 

 Again, you don’t have to be a Senior writer to document quality content. The best things you need are consistency, technical knowledge. Don‘t miss out on using the right tools, and stay organized.

Also, join technical writers support groups. Engineers have a lot of them and it’s also the big reason why the community is thriving.
